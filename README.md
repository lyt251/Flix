### Notes
Since I was running my project every so often to ensure that the build was successful, I realized there were times in which it would clash due to not payng close attention to the labeling and names of the identifiers for the view controllers. Hence, I truly realized the importance of carefully and acccurately identifying the elements.

### Notes

Since this was my first time personally working with APIs, I ran through a couple of mistakes with my code as the build ended up failing a few times upon the preview execution, but after spending a decent amount of time tracing back my steps and exploring the software features, I was able to resolve the issues. The calls for the movie posters were eventually visible, the captions and titles fit more into the screen, and the launch screen worked. Additionally, I initally thought the various sidebars and screens were a bit intimdating and had trouble knowing exactly where the swift code could be edited but by the end of the assignment, I was more comfortable with locating it along with working with common elements of Xcode like labels and images.
